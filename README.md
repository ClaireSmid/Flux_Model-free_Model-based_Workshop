## How to do the workshop
Inside this repository, we have uploaded all the exercise scripts that you will work with during the workshop today. If you are not familiar with Github, **the easiest way to work with these files is to click on the green button with 'Code' in it on the top right, and then clicking on 'Download ZIP' in the drop-down menu to download these scripts to your computer, where you can unzip them.** We would recommend for this workshop that you **download the files to your desktop**, so you have them easily accessible. We would also recommend you use **Google Chrome**, especially if using Google Colab.

We will work through the scripts chronologically, and ask you to just open one script at a time, starting with Step1_ModelFreeRL. 

#### Using Google Colab
If you want to work with Google Colab, the easiest way is to then upload the unzipped folder to your Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive). Once this is done, you can open the script in Google colab just by double-clicking on a script! 

#### Using Jupyter Notebook
If you want to work with Jupyter Notebook instead, the easiest way is to use Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/) which is like a package manager for Python based applications. If you launch Jupyter notebook from there, it will open in your browser, and you can navigate to the downloaded scripts on your computer inside Jupyter Notebook and open them from there.

#### Other Python editors
You can of course also open the scripts in other Python applications (e.g. PyCharm, Spyder), **however, we would recommend using either Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook so you can work with interactive cells.**

## Work with copies!
When you do the exercises we would recommend that you **copy** the exercise script, just so that you can have a backup version to refer back to if you get stuck during the exercise. You can easily to this in Google Colab by clicking on 'File' and then 'Save a copy in drive' which will open up a new tab with a copy of the script. In Jupyter Notebook, you can click on 'File' and then 'Make a Copy'.

## Solutions to exercises
Throughout the workshop, we will upload the solutions to the exercies in the 'Solutions' folder. Note that it is empty at the start of the workshop! We really want you to give the exercises a try, and if you get stuck, do reach out to us for help - that's what we're here for :)

To download the solutions script that will get added throughout the workshop, the easiest way is to just download the folder again (by clicking on the green button with 'Code'), and then you can pull the newly added script from the latest zip, and place it in the folder you already downloaded previously, or just drag it straight to your Google Drive if that's what you're using!
